# SKFR-Python
## Simple and Scalable Sparse k-means Clustering via Feature Ranking

References : [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08541)

Implementation in R and Julia by Author : [GitHub](https://github.com/ZhiyueZ/SKFR)

In the iPython Notebook there is a tensor implementation of the SKFR1 algorithm using pytorch which can be run on GPU as well.

Note: In case of missing features in datapoints the I have removed the datapoint before training but this is not the optimal solution suggested by the authors of the paper
